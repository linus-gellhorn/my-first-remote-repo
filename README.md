# My First Remote Repo

This is my first remote repo.

It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!

And now I've added some changes!

I want another cup of tea. And another.

Added this line through Nano.

Added this line to test using the SSH protocol.
